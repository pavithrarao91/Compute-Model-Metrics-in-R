# Compute-Model-Metrics-in-R
This R script contains function to compute model metrics like MAD, MSE, MAPE R2 for numeric predictor variable.
R code to compute the binary model metrics like Log-likelihood, AIC and BIC.
This code could be further used to compare 2 models based on these metrics.
It also contains function to create confusion matrix for logestic model based on a given probability cut-off value.
Finally plot ROC and AUC to assess the model fits.
